FIRST GOAL:
The aim of this work was to develop a Python program supported by SQL scripts.The program is designed to download
orders from a specific database, then group and sort them according to established criteria.The key function is 
the implementation of a greedy algorithm that intelligently assigns orders to available machines.

DEVELOPMENT:
The program will be expanded with a predictive model that will count the time needed to complete individual tasks,
because current time standards are underestimated. The method of assigning tasks will also change to be consistent 
with the results of the predictive model.
